    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with
        foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let
        the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>

    <h2>How to Store and Reheat Lasagna</h2>
    <p>You can keep leftover lasagna in the refrigerator for about three to four days. To reheat lasagna, cover it with
        foil and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 30 minutes, or until it's heated through and the cheese
        is bubbly.</p>

    <h2>How to Freeze Lasagna</h2>
    <p>You can freeze lasagna for up to three months. To freeze it, let it cool completely, then transfer it to an
        airtight container or heavy-duty freezer bag. Label the package with the date, and freeze for up to three
        months. To reheat lasagna from the freezer, partially thaw in the refrigerator overnight, then bake as directed
        in Step 6.</p>

    <h2>How to Serve Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is best served hot or at room temperature. If you're reheating leftovers, let them sit at room
        temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into them.</p>
